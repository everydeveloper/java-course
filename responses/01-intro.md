# Java Course

Java is a popular programming language for several main reasons:

* It works on many different platforms.
* It's easy to learn and open source. 
* It's fast and powerful.

Java is considered an *Object Oriented* programming language, making it easy to encapsulate data (and methods) in a _class_. A class is like a blue-print that contains all the properties that will be inherited by the _objects_ created by it. This makes it easy to organize and re-use blocks of code.

Java is also a compiled language, meaning that it needs to be translated into machine readable code before it can run.
